Abstract
Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers notable computational advantages;
however, the limited qubit count and system noise inherent to the Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era pose significant obstacles to pro-
cessing real-world images and large, specialized datasets. To address these
challenges, we introduce FireQuan, a hybrid quantum-classical architecture
for multi-domain image classification. The framework centers on two con-
tributions: (1) the Fire512 Head, a compact convolutional feature extractor
that reduces the number of parameters by up to 98.90% and FLOPs by over
98.00% compared to ResNet50, while preserving network depth for learning
complex features; and (2) a patch-based encoding strategy that combines am-
plitude and angle encoding principles with data re-uploading to load classical
features into qubits using only single-qubit rotation gates, thereby eliminat-
ing Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates during the encoding phase. This encod-
ing reduces physical circuit depth by over 99.60% and the total gate count by
over 97.00% relative to Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI)
and Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) for equivalent-sized
feature vectors. Empirical evaluation across 13 datasets spanning 5 domains

demonstrates that FireQuan performs competitively, achieving 95.74% on
EuroSAT and 86.70% on PatchCamelyon (PCAM), while outperforming sev-
eral Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), Quantum Convolutional
Neural Network (QCNN), and contemporary hybrid methods.
FireQuan
maintains a generalization gap below 10.00% even on datasets with high
noise and class imbalance, highlighting its practical value for current quan-
tum systems.

1. Introduction
Image classification is increasingly important across industries such as
medicine, transportation, and agriculture, where it reduces manual labor and
improves accuracy. Deep learning models such as ResNet (He et al., 2016) and
VGGNet (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015) achieve strong results but require
large datasets and extensive training, incurring high computational costs that
limit their use in resource-constrained settings. As application domains incor-
porating heterogeneous data continue to grow, implementing multi-domain
classification on edge devices becomes increasingly difficult (Manukian et al.,
2019; Wang et al., 2020) due to model size, computational cost, and poor
convergence in data-scarce environments.
Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising approach
to address these limitations (Bressan, 1978; Morandi, 2011; Alda, 1980).
QML integrates classical theories with high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, en-
abling the modeling of complex systems through superposition and quantum
entanglement. However, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
era (Preskill, 2018), limited qubit availability, shallow circuit depth, and
hardware noise constrain the implementation of fully quantum approaches.
Consequently, hybrid quantum-classical models have become the preferred
solution, where classical neural networks perform feature extraction while
parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) provide enhanced nonlinear repre-
sentation with relatively few parameters (Benedetti et al., 2019; Xie et al.,
2025; Park et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025; He et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023;
Baek et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2021; Ganjefar et al., 2015; da Silva et al.,
2016; Zhang et al., 2022; Marcian`o et al., 2022).

Despite these advances, most QML research relies on small-scale datasets
(Senokosov et al., 2024; Long et al., 2025) such as MNIST (Deng, 2012),
FashionMNIST (Xiao et al., 2017), or CIFAR10 (Giuste and Vizcarra, 2020),
which do not capture the complexity of real-world multi-domain classifica-
tion, including data noise, variable shapes, and distortions. Many existing
hybrid architectures exhibit limited generalization on heterogeneous, noisy
data (Wu et al., 2025). Overfitting occurs when classical backbones have
too many parameters or when data encoding fails to preserve local fea-
tures (Benedetti et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2025). Minimizing model parameters
while achieving adequate accuracy, especially in medical or agricultural con-
texts, remains a challenge (Wu et al., 2025; Biamonte et al., 2017; Schuld
and Killoran, 2022).
To address these challenges, our contributions are as follows:
• We introduce FireQuan, a lightweight hybrid quantum-classical archi-
tecture for multi-domain image classification that uses 85 times fewer
parameters than ResNet50 (He et al., 2016).
• We design Fire512 Head, a compact convolutional backbone based on
SqueezeNet (Iandola et al., 2016), which preserves network depth while
reducing the number of parameters by up to 98.90% and FLOPs by
98.00% compared to ResNet50.
• We propose a patch-based encoding strategy that integrates amplitude
and angle encoding principles with data re-uploading to encode features
using only single-qubit gates, reducing physical circuit depth by over
99.60% and total gate count by over 97.00% compared with FRQI (Pa-
rigi et al., 2025) and NEQR (Zhang et al., 2013) for equivalent-sized
inputs.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Sec-
tion 3 presents the methodology. Section 4 describes the experimental setup.
Section 5 reports results. Section 6 presents ablation studies and further
analysis. Section 7 concludes the paper.

cost. A core tension exists: increasing the efficiency of data encoding into
the Hilbert space often requires higher circuit complexity, whereas reducing
complexity may degrade encoding quality. This section reviews key research
directions in data encoding methods and hybrid quantum-classical architec-
tures, identifying gaps that motivated FireQuan.
2.1. Quantum encoding methods
Encoding classical data into quantum states is a critical step in QML,
directly influencing performance and hardware requirements (Huang et al.,
2021; Zheng et al., 2025). Existing methods can be grouped into four cate-
gories based on their mapping principles and hardware costs (Pande, 2024;
Khan et al., 2024; Sharma and N, 2024).
2.1.1. Direct mapping encodings
This group includes Basis Encoding
(Benioff, 1980), Unary Encoding
(Romero et al., 2017), Angle Encoding
(Mitarai et al., 2018), and Phase
Encoding
(Coppersmith, 2002). Each data feature is mapped to a basis
state or single-qubit gate configuration. These methods have simple con-
struction and low circuit depth since no two-qubit gates are used, making
them noise-resistant. However, qubit requirements scale linearly with input
dimensionality, often exceeding the capacity of current quantum computers
for high-dimensional data.
They are therefore most suitable for small or
low-dimensional datasets.
2.1.2. Global compression encodings
To address qubit limitations, Amplitude Encoding compresses N features
into log2 N qubits by encoding data as quantum-state probability amplitudes.
While theoretically optimal for qubit efficiency, this approach requires deep
circuits with many two-qubit gates for state preparation, which is problematic
for NISQ hardware. Furthermore, the near-uniform distribution of encoded
data in the Hilbert space reduces measurement efficiency and contributes to
barren plateaus during training (Wang et al., 2025).
2.1.3. Image-specific quantum encodings
Specialized methods such as FRQI (Parigi et al., 2025) and NEQR (Zhang
et al., 2013; Haque et al., 2023) preserve both pixel values and spatial struc-
ture by encoding images as quantum states. However, these techniques re-
quire substantial numbers of multi-qubit control gates, particularly CNOT
