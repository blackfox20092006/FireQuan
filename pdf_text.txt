Abstract
Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers notable computational advantages;
however, the limited qubit count and system noise inherent to the Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era pose significant obstacles to pro-
cessing real-world images and large, specialized datasets. To address these
challenges, we introduce FireQuan, a hybrid quantum-classical architecture
for multi-domain image classification. The framework centers on two con-
tributions: (1) the Fire512 Head, a compact convolutional feature extractor
that reduces the number of parameters by up to 98.90% and FLOPs by over
98.00% compared to ResNet50, while preserving network depth for learning
complex features; and (2) a patch-based encoding strategy that combines am-
plitude and angle encoding principles with data re-uploading to load classical
features into qubits using only single-qubit rotation gates, thereby eliminat-
ing Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates during the encoding phase. This encod-
ing reduces physical circuit depth by over 99.60% and the total gate count by
over 97.00% relative to Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI)
and Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) for equivalent-sized
feature vectors. Empirical evaluation across 13 datasets spanning 5 domains
