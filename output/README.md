# Output Directory

This directory stores various training results, evaluation metrics, and model checkpoints generated during the execution of the FireQuan project.

## Directory Structure

*   **`./checkpoints/`**: Contains the best performing model weights saved as `.msgpack` binary files (from JAX/Flax) during the main training loops (`src/engines/train.py`).
*   **`./resnet18_weights/`**: Contains fine-tuned classical ResNet18 model checkpoints (`.pth` files from PyTorch) produced by `finetune_resnet.py`.

## Files

*   **`results_*.txt`**: Log files containing epoch-by-epoch training and testing metrics (Loss, Accuracy, Recall, F1 Macro) for various configurations of the hybrid quantum model.
*   **`ablation_*.txt`**: Results dedicated to the ablation studies (e.g., removing quantum components or classical CNN blocks) generated by `ablation/train.py`.
