# Experiments

This directory is intended for storing isolated scripts, temporary Jupyter notebooks, or distinct experimental setups used during the research and development phase of FireQuan. It serves as a scratchpad for testing new quantum circuits, different patch embedding strategies, or architecture modifications without affecting the core production codebase.
